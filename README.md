# Rails Authorization from Scratch

## Description
This exercise follows along Railscast #250 to set up a quick and dirty authorization sign-in-out-up/log in-out process in a Rails app. I did this using Rails 3.2.13. The bcrypt-ruby gem is integral to the success of this procedure as it accesses ActiveModel's has_secure_password method
